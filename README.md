# Synchronization #Leader/Follower Design

Used contraction analysis to design a controller to synchronize two systems with the same dynamics but different initial conditions.
A number of exampels are provided and some cases are simulated, including leader/follower problem and synchronization of two systems.

In Syn_Leader_Follower.slx file, a system tries to synchorinze to the other; while in the  Syn_Leader_Follower_est1.slx file, the two systems try to synchronize to each other.

In the  Syn_Leader_Follower_est2.slx file, a thornier dynamic is studied. And it shows that a system can synchronize to a stable state even thought its initial condition leads it to unstable states without controll.
